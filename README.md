Welcome to X-Wing: Rebellion, an online campaign manager for X-Wing: Miniatures Game by Fantasy FLight.

In its simplest form X-Wing: Rebellion is a mix between Battleships and Risk. The game takes place on the edge of the Empire's influence. The Rebel side attempts to grow their forces, whilst the Empire must seek out and destroy the rumoured Rebel threat. 

#Setup

Rebels secretly place their forces. Imperials start on any edge of the map. Imperial numbers are higher and their objective is to remove all rebel forces from the sector of space. As the imperials search various sectors of space, battles are triggered when forces meet if neither side flees. The rebel objective is secretly chosen and can be anything from taking out a particular imperial leader before losing x amount of points worth of ships, to simply growing their forces to a certain size by recruiting from the systems within the map (by winning battles and saving neutral outposts to win favour and supplies).

The map is a generated grid consisting of nebulas, star systems, debris fields and empty space. Each campaign round, ships may move at light speed in a straight line but must stop at any none empty space they attempt to move past. When forces meet in space, either side may chose to jump away. The chasing player may try to guess where they jumped. They may split their forces to track them or send probes out (at a small expense - we'll discuss resources later). A player may choose to leave a few ships behind to slow the chasing forces down while the rest escape.

Destroyed ships: Named pilots whose ship is destroyed in battle are always considered to have ejected. If the opposing player wins the battle they take ejected pilots prisoner. If the player whose pilot's ship was destroyed wins then the pilot returns safely but a new ship must be resourced.

For each turn a battle takes place either side may receive reinforcements from any other ships they have in neighbouring sectors of the map.

Facilities: each side may set up various facilities in non-empty sectors of space depending on the type of sector (star system, asteroid belt etc). Facilities cost resources to create but generate resources of certain types during the campaign. This coupled with rebels recruiting from planets and imperials receiving reinforcements as matter of course provide the resources that allow players to build or buy more ships, probes and facilities.

Capital ships: capital ships like star destroyers may travel with forces around the grid map but do not directly engage in combat, only shoot through the play area essentially creating zones of denial. Before the planning phase any capital ship in the sector may place a firing template on the board. If during movement any ship ends up overlapping that template it is instantly destroyed. Also, some capital ships are necessary to transport ships without light speed.
